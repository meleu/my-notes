## trying 11r

- clone the repo <https://github.com/reeseschultz/11r>
- edit `src/globals/site.json`
- comment the following lines in `src/includes/page.njk`:
```html
<!-- {% include 'top-notice.njk' %} -->
<!-- {% include 'privacy-notice.njk' %} --> 
```

UPDATE: I didn't like it... to much hardcoded stuff. :(
