## Redis

I don't know what is the exact usefulness of redis and what kind of problem
it tries to solve.


## NAT

I need to remember what exactly is NAT, what it does and how it works.


## VPN

I need to understand, at least in general, how a Virtual Private Network works.


## nslookup

What the `nslookup` command does?

[Note: I remember the "TCP/IP Illustrated" book explains it very well and with practical examples.]
