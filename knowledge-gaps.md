[✏️](https://github.com/meleu/my-notes/edit/master/gaps.md)

## Redis

I don't know what is the exact usefulness of redis and what kind of problem
it tries to solve.


## NAT

I need to remember what exactly is NAT, what it does and how it works.


## VPN

I need to understand, at least in general, how a Virtual Private Network works.


## nslookup

What the `nslookup` command does?

OK, it "shows the DNS config", but I want the details. I want to be able to explain it like using the Feynman Technique.

[Note: I remember the "TCP/IP Illustrated" book explains it very well and with practical examples.]


## SSH

Explain how exactly SSH public and private keys work? (the concpets)


## LDAP

What exactly is LDAP?


## TLS/SSL

How TLS/SSL certificates work?

possibly useful reading: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-let-s-encrypt-commercial-and-private-certificate-authorities-and-self-signed-ssl-certificates>
