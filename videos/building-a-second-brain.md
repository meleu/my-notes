- The Perspective Era
    - Space - ran out of resources
    - Time - ran out of time
    - Attention - spend time wisely
    - Perspective - having an opinion about **what matters**
    - We are flooded with information - seek the high ground

- Richard Feynman quote:
> You have to keep **a dozen of your favorite problems** constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, **teste agains each of your twelve problems** to see wheter it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say "How did he do it? **He must be a genius!**"

    - capture: write things down
    - organize: sort the material

- What to capture? (some filters)
    - inspiring - is this something that could inspire me in the future?
    - useful - could this be useful for future projects?
    - personal - is this hard-won knowlede gained through personal experience?
    - surprising - does this violates my expectations or go against my mental models?
