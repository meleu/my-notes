## 1. Software architecture isn't about big design up front

Responding to change over following a plan

"Big design up front is dumb. Doing no design up front is even dumber." - Dave Thomas

- Q: How much?
- A: Just enough.

Enough up front design to create a good **starting point** and **direction**.


"Architecture represents the **significant decisions**, where significance is measured by **cost of change.** - Grady Booch


## 2. Every software team needs to consider software architecture

Every "software system" needs **technical leadership**.


## 3. The software architecture role is about coding, coaching and collaboration

Different types of teams need different leadership styles.

Book recomendation: Elastic Leadership - Growing self-organizing teams - Roy

Soft skills:

- leadership
- communication
- presentation
- influencing
- collaboration
- coaching and mentoring
- motivation
- facilitation
- political
- etc

- Q: Should software architects write **code**?
- A: Yes.



## 4. You don't need to use UML

Teams need a **ubiquitous language** to communicate effectively.

C4 model: Context, Containers, Components, and Code

<https://c4model.com/>

A **common set of abstractions** is more important than a common notation.

tooling: structurizr


## 5. A good software architecture enables agility

Agile is about moving fast, embracing change, releasing often, getting feedback, ...

Agile is about a mindset of **continuous improvement**.

Agility is **quality attribute**.

"A good architecture rarely happens through **architecture-indifferent design**."

George Fairbanks - author of Just Enough Software Architecture
