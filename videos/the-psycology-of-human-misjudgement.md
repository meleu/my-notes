- 1:20 - book: Influence - Robert Cialdini (same author of "Persuasion")
    - "filled a lot of holes in my crude system"

- 2:50 - 24 standard causes of human misjudgement

1. 2:55
    - the power of incentives
    - "man with hammer syndrome" - to the man with a hammer every problem tends to look pretty much like a nail

2. 6:10
    - simple psychological denial: reality is too painful to bear, so you just distort it until it's bearable (we all do that at some extent)
    - that's one of the psychological misjudgement that causes terrible problems

3. 6:55
    - agency cost: too trusting advisors who don't know more than you
    - tbh I didn't understand the examples very well (language barrier)

4. 10:20
    - bias from consistency and commitment tendency (including the tendency to avoid or promptly resolve cognitive dissonance)/ self-confirmation tendency (hard to change your mind once emotionally committed to an idea)
    - human mind is similar to an human egg. Human egg has a shutoff device so when sperm gets in it shuts down so the next one can't get in. The human mind has a big tendency of the same sort.

5. ???
