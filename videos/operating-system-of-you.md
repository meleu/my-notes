> Lately, I've been working on grouping similar tasks. For example, **meetings should all happen in succession** because it's easier for me to jump from one to another than it is having an hour in between. I'm also more keen to communicate with others on Monday, when I'm getting the lay of the land. Towards the end of the week, my energy is higher if I'm dedicated to coding, especially if I've allotted **uninterrupted time**.
> 
> **Notice when your energy levels are high and when they wane. Notice when you're more productive for social activities and when you're better off working in asolation.** The more you study yourself, the easier planning becomes."

- Sarah Drasner


## Part 4: Kernel

The Ghost in the Machine

Only Intrinsic Motivation Lasts - Daniel Vassallo:

> When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. **Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.**


From the book "Drive" - Dan Pink:

> **As children, we are driven by our inner desires to learn, to discover and to help others**. But as we grow, we are programmed by our society to need extrinsic motivations: if we take out the trash, study hard, and work tirelessly, we will be rewarded with friendly praise, high grades and good paychecks. Slowly, we lose more and more of our intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic promises destroy intrinsic motivation.

## Final Words

Emotions:

- How you feel is valid
- It's OK to ask for help
- Everyone has insecurities
- Learning < Being Happy
- Forgive Yourself


"Good Enough" is better than "Best"

Costs of looking for The Best:

- Happiness
- Cooperation (Zero Sum)
- Efficiency (Paretto's 80/20)
- Agency (Gamifying)

You only need what's good enough.
