# Bonus - Databases

## 01. Databases in development process

Developers need database for local development.

- Option 1:
    - Each developer install mysql DB locally
    - Each developer has their own DB with own test data
    - 👍 can't mess up with someonelse's test DB data
    - 👎 start from empty DB (needs realistic test data)
    - 👎 have to install and setup DB for EVERY developer

- Option 2:
    - DB hosted remotely
    - 👍 no need for local installation (start coding right away)
    - 👍 test data available right from the start
    - 👎 can't play around without affecting others

- Ideal solution: have both!

In your application code you configure the DB connectivity. You have to tell the library, **WHICH** DB to talk to and **HOW** to **AUTHENTICATE** with that DB.

**DO NOT HARDCODE CREDENTIALS IN THE CODE**

Define in 1 place as environment variables (or a `.env` file).

Depending on environment (dev, test, prod), connects to different DB. Each ahs different endpoints and credentials (PROD more secured).

Define a variable in code, and then set endpoint/credentials from outside for each environment.

**Configure externally** instead of hardcode.

- Java/Spring Application with Spring properties file.
    - Define the values in the properties file
    - Reference the value in the Java App

- Logging level
    - log more in development mode
    - log less in production mode (e.g.: only errors)

- As a DevOps Engineer, you need to know:
    - how to configure DB
    - how to setup DB
    - how to manage DB
        - replication
        - backups
        - restore DB
