# Bonus - Databases

## 01. Databases in development process

Developers need database for local development.

- Option 1:
    - Each developer install mysql DB locally
    - Each developer has their own DB with own test data
    - 👍 can't mess up with someonelse's test DB data
    - 👎 start from empty DB (needs realistic test data)
    - 👎 have to install and setup DB for EVERY developer

- Option 2:
    - DB hosted remotely
    - 👍 no need for local installation (start coding right away)
    - 👍 test data available right from the start
    - 👎 can't play around without affecting others

- Ideal solution: have both!

In your application code you configure the DB connectivity. You have to tell the library, **WHICH** DB to talk to and **HOW** to **AUTHENTICATE** with that DB.

**DO NOT HARDCODE CREDENTIALS IN THE CODE**

Define in 1 place as environment variables (or a `.env` file).

Depending on environment (dev, test, prod), connects to different DB. Each ahs different endpoints and credentials (PROD more secured).

Define a variable in code, and then set endpoint/credentials from outside for each environment.

**Configure externally** instead of hardcode.

- Java/Spring Application with Spring properties file.
    - Define the values in the properties file
    - Reference the value in the Java App

- Logging level
    - log more in development mode
    - log less in production mode (e.g.: only errors)

- As a DevOps Engineer, you need to know:
    - how to configure DB
    - how to setup DB
    - how to manage DB
        - replication
        - backups
        - restore DB


## DataBase Types

- Why so many databases?
- How are they different?
- Which one should I use for my App?

### Key Value Databases

- Popular implementations:
    - Redis
    - Memcached
    - etcd from Kubernetes

- Features:
    - unique key
    - no joins
    - data stored in memory:
        - 👍 very fast
        - 👎 limited storage
    - not used as primary DB

- best for:
    - **caching**
    - message queue

### Wide Column Databases

| row key | column \n name | column \n age |
| mike    | mike | 21 |

- Popular implementations:
    - Cassandra
    - Apache HBase

- features:
    - schema-less
    - queries similar to SQL
    - 👍 scalable
    - 👎 no joins
    - 👎 limited compared to relational DB
    - not used as primary DB

- best used for:
    - time series
    - IoT records
    - historical records

### Document Databases

- Popular implementations
    - MongoDB
    - Dynamo DB
    - CouchDB

```
Document

"name": "Mike"
"age": 29
```

- features
    - schema-less
        - documents are grouped in Collections, and Collections can be organized in a hierarchy
        - not recommeded for "connected data"
    - no joins
    - 👎 slower writes (compared to relational DB)
    - 👍 faster to read
    - 👍 easy to get started
    - 👍 can be used as primary DB
    - recommended for situations where you still don't know how the data is going to be structured

- best used for:
    - mobile apps
    - game apps
    - CMS
    - most apps


### Relational Databases

- Popular implementations:
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle DB

- features
    - **most used!**
    - structured data
    - schema and data types needs to be created first
    - data is organized in tables
    - normalizing to avoid duplicated data
    - 👍 ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
        - No half-changes are updated in database
    - 👎 difficult to scale
        - **Note**: CockroachDB was specifically designed to solve the scalability issue.


### Graph Databases

Nodes and Edges

- Popular implementations:
    - Neo4j
    - Dgraph

- features
    - directly connect entities
    - edges are the relationships
    - 👍 easier to query

- best used for:
    - graphs
    - patterns
    - recommendation


### Search Databases

- Popular implementations:
    - ElasticSearch
    - Solr

- Features:
    - Search Database through massive data entries
    - Full text search in efficient and fast way
    - Similar to document-oriented database
    - creates index of words

### Wrap Up

- Choose database type based on your App needs
- Or Combinations
    - For most data: Relational
    - To handle fast search: Search Engine
    - Cache: Key Value
